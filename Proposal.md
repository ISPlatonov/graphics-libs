# Project Proposal - Simulation of life in a 2D world

## Abstract

With developments in algorithms and computing power, simulations have become an important tool for studying complex systems. Simulations can be used to model the behavior of systems that are too complex to be analyzed analytically. They can also be used to study the behavior of systems under different conditions, or to predict the behavior of systems in the future. One area where simulations have been particularly useful is in the study of behavior of living organisms. Simulations of life in a 2D world have been used to study the behavior of organisms in a controlled environment.

The project aims to simulate life in a 2D world. The world will be a grid of cells, each cell can be empty or occupied by an organism. The organisms will have a set of characteristics that will determine their behavior and interactions with other organisms. The simulation will be based on a set of rules that will define how the organisms move, reproduce, and interact with each other. The goal of the project is to create a simulation that is both realistic (in terms of experiment) and interesting to observe.
